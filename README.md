MY FIRST TASK IN DATA SCIENCE COURSE
Task is from the Information source: gazeta.uz, and answers with functions belong to me.
Theme: Dealing with n-dimensional arrays:
Here are the gm_2020.npz and gm_2021.npz files placed and used (these 2 files are placed for example and you can use your own files instead)
*PART(1): Downloading data.Data : The data is stored in two files named gm_2020.npzva and gm_2021.npzko respectively. As you can see from the npz extension, each file contains arrays (in our case two arrays, (1) Car model name, (2) number of cars manufactured). 
The problem is to execute a function after downloading each file that splits them into two matching arrays. Make sure your constructor function accepts a filename as an argument. 
Arrays: stored under models and qnts
*PART(2): Total number of cars produced.
Using our data extractor function created above, we will now perform operations on the data.
Problem : Using data, run a function that calculates the total number of cars produced in 2020 and 2021.
*PART(3): Production numbers of some cars.Problem: Imagine that an employer has asked you to extract from all the data only the models Damas, Nexia, Cobalt, and Gentra that were produced in 2020 and 2021. You should continue with the function that performs this task.
*PART(4): What is the percentage of the total number of cars produced for some cars?
Above, we have extracted from all the data how many cars produced in 2020 and 2021 only Damas, Nexia, Cobalt, and Gentra.
Problem: Now let's calculate what percentage of the total produced cars these cars make up. Create a function that does this.
